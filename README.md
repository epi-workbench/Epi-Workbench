# Epi-Workbench
The Epi-Workbench repository is the main public facing repository for Epi-Workbench. It isn't tied to a specific course. It contains issues that make up the [course roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/epi-workbench/projects/5).

The [EWBTemplates](https://github.com/epi-workbench/EWBTemplates) repository has additional information and tools for course authors.
